\_Note: For insights into the database and authentication (Supabase), reach out to beuma343@student.otago.ac.nz so he can invite you to the Supabase project. Pulling and running locally is recommended but feel free to test the hostet version as well: https://fresh-flat.vercel.app/ (The confirmation email redirect does not work here though because it is still directed to localhost because this is the recommended way of testing our application)
